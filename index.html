	<font color="blue">
	<p> In this website, you will see my biodata and some of my picture in gallery. But before that, I want to share my inspirational qoutes in studying which is 
	<b>"ALLAH WILL RAISE THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED AMONG YOU AND THOSE WHO WERE GIVEN KNOWLEDGE BY DEGREES" (58:11)</b> It is a Muslim's obligation to acquire knowledge in Islam. This clearly demonstrates that education is highly valued in Islam, and that it promotes not only peace and love, but also study and knowledge.</p>
